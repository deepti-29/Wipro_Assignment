Wipro Day 1 - Git Learning

# Overview
This document provides an overview of the essential steps and concepts covered during Git learning on Day 1 at Wipro, conducted by IITH-TECHADEMY. It includes fundamental topics related to version control and Git usage.

# Topics Covered

## 1. Introduction to Git & Version Control
Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their code efficiently. Version control allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project while maintaining a history of modifications.

## 2. Installing Git
To start using Git, follow these steps:
- Download Git from [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/).
- Install Git using the default settings.
- Verify installation by running the command:
  ```sh
  git --version
  ```

## 3. Configuring Git
Before using Git, configure it with your user details:
```sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
```
These settings associate your commits with your identity.

## 4. Initializing a Repository
To create a new Git repository in your project folder, navigate to the desired directory and run:
```sh
git init
```
This initializes an empty repository in the current directory.

## 5. Adding & Committing Files
After making changes to your project, add files to the staging area and commit them:
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
The `git add .` command stages all changes, and `git commit -m` saves them with a descriptive message.

## 6. Pushing to GitHub
To push your local repository to GitHub:
```sh
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <repository-URL>
git push -u origin main
```
This sets the main branch, connects the local repository to GitHub, and pushes the changes.

## 7. Branching & Merging Basics
Branching allows you to work on different features without affecting the main project. Basic commands include:
```sh
git branch feature-branch
git checkout feature-branch
```
To merge a branch back into `main`:
```sh
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
```
